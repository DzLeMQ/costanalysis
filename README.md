This code investigates the cost of treatment in an insurance dataset using linear regression analysis, specifically applying the Ordinary Least Squares method to identify the key factors influencing treatment costs.
As the results of this study indicate _age_, _smoker_, _children_, and _BMI_ are statistically significant factors. For instance, the results show that for every unit increase in the standardized age variable, 
there is a significant increase in the cost of treatment. The change in Smoker status variable shows the most significant increase in the cost of treatment
